## Bugs

### Where to Find Issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/issues) to track our bugs. We keep a close eye on the issues and try to make it clear when we'll have a fix. Before filing a new issue, please check that it hasn't already been reported.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. If possible please provide this test case along side a [new issue](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/issues/new).

### Proposing a Change

If you intend to introduce something new, or something old doesn't quite fit your needs, feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/issues/new) and we will be more than happy to look at it. Alternatively feel free to talk to us on #platform-fed-xui on slack.

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away.

## Development Workflow

* [SCSS contributing guide](src/sass/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [React contributing guide](src/react/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Releases

The [UXE team](https://github.dev.xero.com/orgs/UXE/teams/uxe-team) coordinate releases.

### Breaking Changes

For each merge into the `breaking-changes` branch, an `-alpha.n` release should be created, where `n` is the alpha
release number.
The release description needs to include the following:

* Clear documentation describing the change and any changes that need to be made by consumers
* The release notes from any previous alpha release (each alpha release should detail ALL previous alpha changes)
