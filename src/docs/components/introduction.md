## Using these docs

The next few sections will help you getting XUI components working in your project either for the first time or migrating from our previously supported bower components. The remainder of the Docs are like a kitchen sink of our components. This includes component documentation examples and API docs. The examples are live running demos of the actual React components and they can be live edited by expanding the code block.

These docs are focused on the technical configuration and use of the XUI React components. If you are looking for why you should use a component, look for a bookmark link back to the XUI Guide where we cover the why for each component.
