// Components: Compositions
//
// Introduction: Compositions provide the structure and responsive behaviour of common page layouts. Each is composed of a number of empty containers that can house content, and offer a range of options for spacing, sizing and layout. Compositions are a great starting point for building new pages or updating fixed-width pages to be responsive.
