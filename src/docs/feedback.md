## Where to give feedback

**Slack** channels are a great place to ask questions for a quicker response. The UXE team has a representative on interrupts who can answer technical questions through the [#platform-fed-xui](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C565NP1A5) channel. For design related feedback you can write you feedback on the [#xui-design](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5) channel.

**Github issues** are the preferred way to raise bugs or feature requests for XUI. These can be reviewed by the team and discussed on a case by case basis. You can raise those [here](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/issues) but before you do so, we ask you check the issue hasn't previously been raised to avoid duplication.

## Contributing
We gladly welcome contributions to our framework. Whether fixing a bug or helping with a wider issue, we ask you review our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file first, which contains our guidelines.
