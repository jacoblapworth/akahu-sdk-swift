// Designing with XUI
//
// Introduction:
// XUI enables designers to move beyond the interface.
// When the basics are covered, we can start to focus our attention on what matters more — solving user problems.

// Why it matters
//
// * <strong>Efficiency</strong>
// </br>
// A lot of design resource can be wasted in a constant attempt to reinvent the wheel.
// A shared library helps us build on what others may have already solved, prioritise the user rather than the UI, and free us up from doing menial, repetitive design tasks like spec-work.
// It saves time and money.
//
// * <strong>Consistency</strong>
// </br>
// Designing with XUI provides us with a shared vocabulary and a common visual language.
// In turn, this helps us communicate effectively as a team and build a body of work that feels like part of a cohesive family.
// Consistent user interfaces aid usability and build trust.
//
// * <strong>Scalability</strong>
// </br>
// A static style guide is not a design system at all.
// Conversely, XUI lets us increment our evolving visual language at scale, equip an increasingly global team, and prepare us for entry into new markets and new products.
// XUI provides a solid foundation for growth.

// Designing responsibly
//
// 1. <strong>Start with the system</strong>
// </br>
// Work hard to make the best from the materials we already have.
// Introduce new concepts consciously and in parallel with the overall system.
// Deviation means stagnation, so do so with intention and good reason.
//
// 2. <strong>Speak in variables</strong>
// </br>
// Remove some of the spec work by using our shared vocabulary around things like spacing units, color and type size.
// Favor shared terms like `grey-1` or `padding-small` over hex-codes and pixel values, which may be subject to change.
// This helps break down the barriers between roles, too.
//
// 3. <strong>Think flexibly</strong>
// </br>
// Avoid brittle interfaces.
// Familiarise yourself with the tools available to you in regard to responsive layouts, accessibility, and localisation.
// Don’t make assumptions about devices, users, or content formats.
//
// 4. <strong>Share early and often</strong>
// </br>
// Avoid designing things in isolation.
// Share work to find wider use cases, additional requirements, or existing solutions.
// A unified experience is better for the user and for Xero than several distinct experiences.
//
// 5. <strong>Contribute back</strong>
// </br>
// Our visual language will never evolve if no one contributes to it.
// Or worse, it will only reflect a select few.
// If you want your voice to be heard, use it.
// Talk with the XUI team to identify areas of improvement or incorporation at all stages of your project, and encourage your developers to do so too.
//
// 6. <strong>Prioritise the user</strong>
// </br>
// Subjectivity is the enemy of a large team, so rationalise your suggestions with research.
// Evidence helps move the system forward.

//
// * <strong>Slack</strong>
// </br>
// There are many things XUI doesn’t yet cover – we need your help!
// Talk to the design systems team if you've got questions or have ideas about how XUI should grow.
// We’ve got a dedicated design channel for this in [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5), so please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
//
// * <strong>Github</strong>
// </br>
// Minor bugs or technical requests are best captured as issues in the main [Github](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/issues) repository.
// There are instructions there to help you format your submission.
// Let us know if you need an account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).

// Getting started
//
// * <strong>Figma</strong>
// </br>
// XUI provides a Team Library which lives in the [Design Systems project](https://www.figma.com/files/713083859032680705/team/713195599671588940/%5BDesign%5D-Systems) in Figma. Any file created within the Xero Figma Org will have the XUI Libraries available to reference.
// </br>
// There is a readme page inside the [XUI Library file](https://www.figma.com/file/Xj2cicSECPYLtBcbMg9jar/XUI-18-%7C-Design-Systems) with a quick how-to, and a Components page – where all the master components live. Please leave feedback and let us know about any bugs, via comments attached to the relevant component inside the Component page.
// </br>
// Updates to a XUI Library will be announced within any Figma file referencing one, or by the XUI team in the #xui-design Slack channel. New files will be announced in Slack.
//
// * <strong>Codepen</strong>
// </br>
// You can also use [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) to quickly prototype XUI interfaces in the browser.
// Our team account has base templates with the correct stylesheets, scripts, icons, and navigation pre-loaded.
// Let us know if you need an account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).
// However, we have limited spaces so if you’re not using it regularly, please get in touch so we can reallocate it to someone who is.
//
// * <strong>Github</strong>
// </br>
// If you’ve got coding chops, you’re also more than welcome to iterate on XUI source code itself.
// Simply visit the [Github](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui) repository and follow the `README.md` instructions.
// Let us know if you need an account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).
// And if you’d like to learn more about front-end, we’re always willing to help.
