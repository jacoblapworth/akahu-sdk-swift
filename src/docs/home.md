## Getting Started

### For Designers

XUI provides guidelines and best practices for when to use certain patterns,
when not to use them and what alternatives could be considered.

* Start with:  [Colors](section-colors.html), [Icons](section-icons.html) & [Typography](section-typography.html)
* Download the latest Sketch template from [XUI Toolkit: releases](https://github.dev.xero.com/designers/xui-toolkit/releases).
* Then explore the components and patterns that XUI CSS provides

#### Limitations

Its goal is to be in lock step with Sketch templates used by designers.
In practice, this has proved much harder than we thought, but it is still an
aspirational goal of XUI. XUI should be used in conjunction with Sketch
templates. If patterns, styles and components already exist everyone will have
a better time.

### For Developers

CSS is hard. XUI's goal is for you to not write CSS. We do this by providing CSS for a suite of validated components and design patterns.

* Explore the components in the [XUI React Docs](react/)
* Explore [Colors](section-colors.html), [Icons](section-icons.html) & [Typography](section-typography.html)
* Explore the patterns and other components that XUI CSS provides

### Using XUI

 * Add the `xui-body` class to your `<body>` element and `xui-html` to your
   `<html>` element, unless you are targeting legacy pages.
   The `xui-body` class provides background color, baseline font
   styling and line height.
   The `xui-html` class sets the height of the `html` element to 100%, and
   the body element with `xui-body` directly under it.
 * For pages with legacy CSS that are unable to use `xui-body`, wrap XUI components in a container
   which has the `xui-container` class applied. This sets properties that XUI relies on,
   such as `box-sizing: border-box`, its default line-height, fonts, etc.
 * Namespace your project's classes appropriately and separately to XUI.
 * Avoid writing your own CSS as much as possible, particularly if your CSS
   overrides XUI's styling. The less custom CSS you have, the easier it will be
   to upgrade to future versions of XUI.
 * In your main application, make sure XUI is loaded or imported before any of
   your other stylesheets.
