## Getting Started

### For Designers

XUI provides guidelines and best practices for when to use certain patterns,
when not to use them and what alternatives could be considered.

* Start with:  [Colors](section-colors.html), [Icons](section-icons.html) & [Typography](section-typography.html)
* Then explore the components and patterns that XUI CSS provides

#### Limitations

Its goal is to be in lock step with Sketch templates used by designers.
In practice, this has proved much harder than we thought, but it is still an
aspirational goal of XUI. XUI should be used in conjunction with Sketch
templates. If patterns, styles and components already exist everyone will have
a better time.

### For Developers

CSS is hard. XUI's goal is for you to not write CSS. We do this by providing CSS for a suite of validated components and design patterns.

* Start with the supported [React components](https://github.dev.xero.com/pages/UXE/Components-Registry/)
* Explore [Colors](section-colors.html), [Icons](section-icons.html) & [Typography](section-typography.html)
* Explore the patterns and other components that XUI CSS provides
