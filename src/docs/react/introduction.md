## _XUI React Docs provide technical, API documentation and interactive examples._

## Getting started

These docs act as a kitchen sink of our components and are focused on the technical configuration and their use. This includes component documentation, examples and API docs. The examples are interactive demos of the components and they can be live-edited by expanding the code block.

### Installing

Checkout [Developing with XUI](../section-getting-started-developing-with-xui.html) in the XUI Guide for all the information on getting XUI setup in your project.

### Upgrading

Keep an eye on our [Releases](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/releases) page in GitHub and this will list any breaking-changes between major versions that may require re-factoring.

If upgrading from XUI version 10 or earlier checkout the [XUI React Docs Â· Upgrading](https://github.dev.xero.com/pages/UXE/xui/docs/11.0.0/react/#upgrading) for XUI version 11. This has the detailed steps from moving from bower to NPM.
