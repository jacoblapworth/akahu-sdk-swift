## Sketch files
There is a seperate Github repository managed by design, that holds the most recent Sketch file. The file name provides an indication of the XUI version it corresponds to.

## Deprecation
You may find sections of code marked for deprecation. This means they are still available in our codebase, but will be removed in an upcoming major release. 

## Experimental flags
You’ll also find an experimental flag alongside newer sections of the design system. These patterns are available to use, but are not guaranteed to be in the next major release. At the very least, they may be subject to change. This gives us a way to test patterns and solidify them before they are fully endorsed.
