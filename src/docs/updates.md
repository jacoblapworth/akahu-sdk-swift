The Github repository holds the most detailed information on exactly what has been released and when. You can view those details in the [releases tab](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/releases)

We also offer a slack channel, [#platform-fed-releases](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C57H6G0RM) announcing releases as they happen.

## Updates Schedule
In order to provide predictability to teams, the UXE team has made a commitment to their release schedule.

- Major - once every 90 days maximum
- Minor - once a month maximum
- Patch - once a week maximum, unless the fix is critical or a security concern.

To read more on our commitments around updates and releases, please see our [Software Lovability Objective in Confluence](https://confluence.inside.xero.com/display/FED/The+UX+Engineering+Team+and+XUI#TheUXEngineeringTeamandXUI-SoftwareLovabilityObjectives)

## Future Updates
You may find sections of code marked as 'Deprecated' but not removed. The intention is these pieces of code and supporting documentation will be removed in an upcoming major release.

There's also an 'Experimental' flags added to newer sections of the design system. These patterns are available in the underlying code. However, they are not guaranteed to be in the next major release. This gives us a way to test out patterns and solidify them as they're put through their paces.
