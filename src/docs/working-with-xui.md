	Set some expectations about what it is and does. It’s unlikely to solve everything. You’ll still need to design. We’re here to help — and link off to [feedback](./section-feedback.html) and [updates](./section-updates.html) pages

## Developing with XUI

Probably hit our getting started guide on Github

### CSS

XUI styling can be applied on it’s own.
Handy if you're prototyping things and there's a tokens file here too.
We use BEM
Here's some info about writing custom styles

### React

XUI comes with a few fully supported React Components to deliver complex interactions in consistent ways.
Look out for the [React Icon] to when there's a matching component or browse the [XUI React Docs](https://github.dev.xero.com/pages/UXE/Components-Registry/)



## Designing with XUI

Start with XUI. Work to make the best thing from the materials we already have. Introduce new concepts consciously and in concert with the overall system. If you're struggling to meet users’ needs then talk it through with the systems team.

Understand the foundations. XUI assumes a few things and falls over if used for things it wasn't designed for so get your head around the principles.

### Custom

Avoid custom for the sake of it - sometimes 100% positive for a specific situation can be a significant negative in a users overall experience of Xero.

### Managing the development process

What to expect from devs

### Handy tools

There's a [Sketch file](https://github.dev.xero.com/designers/xui-toolkit).

Get into HTML - Codepen is useful for prototyping.






## Information for product teams

This should let you build things quicker.
Challenge your designer.
Get design architect involved at the planning stage.
What sort of commitment is involved? Will I have to keep updating shit?

## What if XUI doesn't have what I need?
