// Developing with XUI
//
// XUI provides both a CSS library and a set of standard React components. It can be used as
// the basis for fresh projects or run alongside legacy CSS.
//
// Start using XUI styles by adding the stylesheet to the head of your page
// Probably hit our getting started guide on Github
//
// ### CSS
//
// XUI styling can be applied on it’s own.
// Handy if you're prototyping things and there's a tokens file here too.
// We use BEM
// Here's some info about writing custom styles
//
// ### React
//
// XUI comes with a few fully supported React Components to deliver complex interactions in consistent ways.
// Look out for the [React Icon] to when there's a matching component or browse the [XUI React Docs](react/).
