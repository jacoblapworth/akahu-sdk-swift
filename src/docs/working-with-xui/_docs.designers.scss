// Handy tools
//
// Make fast mockups with [XUI Sketch tools](https://github.dev.xero.com/designers/xui-design-toolkit)
//
// You can use [Codepen](https://codepen.io/dashboard/) to quickly prototype XUI interfaces. Our team account has base templates with XUI CSS pulled in already.

// Tips
//
// **Start with XUI.** Work hard to make the best thing from the materials we already have. Introduce new concepts consciously
// and in concert with the overall system.
//
// **Think variables not pixels.** Remove some of the mockup to HTML pain by using a shared language
// around things like [spacing units](), [colour]() and [type size]().

// Contributing
//
// There’s many things XUI doesn’t yet cover – it needs your help! Talk to the design systems team if you've got questions or have ideas about how XUI should grow.
//
// Minor XUI bugs are best captured as an issue in the [main XUI Github repo](). If you'd like to see things improved in the Sketch tools add those to the [Design Toolkit repo](https://github.dev.xero.com/designers/xui-design-toolkit/issues).
