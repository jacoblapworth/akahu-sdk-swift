// Designing with XUI
//
// Introduction:
// XUI enables designers to move beyond the interface.
// When the basics are covered, we can start to focus our attention on what matters more — solving user problems.

// Why it matters
//
// * <strong>Efficiency</strong>
// </br>
// A lot of design resource can be wasted in a constant attempt to reinvent the wheel.
// A shared library helps us build on what others may have already solved, prioritise the user rather than the UI, and free us up from doing menial, repetitive design tasks like spec-work.
// It saves time and money.
//
// * <strong>Consistency</strong>
// </br>
// Designing with XUI provides us with a shared vocabulary and a common visual language.
// In turn, this helps us communicate effectively as a team and build a body of work that feels like part of a cohesive family.
// Consistent user interfaces aid usability and build trust.
//
// * <strong>Scalability</strong>
// </br>
// A static style guide is not a design system at all.
// Conversely, XUI lets us increment our evolving visual language at scale, equip an increasingly global team, and prepare us for entry into new markets and new products.
// XUI provides a solid foundation for growth.

// Designing responsibly
//
// 1. <strong>Start with the system</strong>
// </br>
// Work hard to make the best from the materials we already have.
// Introduce new concepts consciously and in parallel with the overall system.
// Deviation means stagnation, so do so with intention and good reason.
//
// 2. <strong>Speak in variables</strong>
// </br>
// Remove some of the spec work by using our shared vocabulary around things like spacing units, color and type size.
// Favor shared terms like `grey-1` or `padding-small` over hex-codes and pixel values, which may be subject to change.
// This helps break down the barriers between roles, too.
//
// 3. <strong>Think flexibly</strong>
// </br>
// Avoid brittle interfaces.
// Familiarise yourself with the tools available to you in regard to responsive layouts, accessibility, and localisation.
// Don’t make assumptions about devices, users, or content formats.
//
// 4. <strong>Share early and often</strong>
// </br>
// Avoid designing things in isolation.
// Share work to find wider use cases, additional requirements, or existing solutions.
// A unified experience is better for the user and for Xero than several distinct experiences.
//
// 5. <strong>Contribute back</strong>
// </br>
// Our visual language will never evolve if no one contributes to it.
// Or worse, it will only reflect a select few.
// If you want your voice to be heard, use it.
// Talk with the XUI team to identify areas of improvement or incorporation at all stages of your project, and encourage your developers to do so too.
//
// 6. <strong>Prioritise the user</strong>
// </br>
// Subjectivity is the enemy of a large team, so rationalise your suggestions with research.
// Evidence helps move the system forward.

//
// * <strong>Slack</strong>
// </br>
// There are many things XUI doesn’t yet cover – we need your help!
// Talk to the design systems team if you've got questions or have ideas about how XUI should grow.
// We’ve got a dedicated design channel for this in [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5), so please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
//
// * <strong>Github</strong>
// </br>
// Minor bugs or technical requests are best captured as issues in the main [Github](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/issues) repository.
// There are instructions there to help you format your submission.
// Let us know if you need an account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).
//
// * <strong>Trello</strong>
// </br>
// Additionally, if you'd like to raise a specific design concept, feature, or track progress on any requests you’ve made in the past, visit our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/LZhG5Yrr/xui-design-backlog) board.
// You can vote on cards others have raised too.
// There are instructions there to help you format your submission.

// Getting started
//
// * <strong>Sketch</strong>
// </br>
// XUI provides a Sketch Library that [can be found on Sketch Cloud](https://sketch.cloud/s/yypWq).
// This library provides a set of symbols that represent XUI components, and allows the user to edit their content, layout and states. To use this library, follow the link above and in Sketch Cloud select ‘Use as Library’. This will ensure you receive notifications when updates to the Library are available. In Sketch Cloud you can navigate to the pages found within the Sketch file to view symbols and leave comments/feedback/requests.
//
// * <strong>Codepen</strong>
// </br>
// You can also use [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) to quickly prototype XUI interfaces in the browser.
// Our team account has base templates with the correct stylesheets, scripts, icons, and navigation pre-loaded.
// Let us know if you need an account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).
// However, we have limited spaces so if you’re not using it regularly, please get in touch so we can reallocate it to someone who is.
//
// * <strong>Github</strong>
// </br>
// If you’ve got coding chops, you’re also more than welcome to iterate on XUI source code itself.
// Simply visit the [Github](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui) repository and follow the `README.md` instructions.
// Let us know if you need an account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).
// And if you’d like to learn more about front-end, we’re always willing to help.
