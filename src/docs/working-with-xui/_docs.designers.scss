// Tools
//
// Create fast mockups with the [XUI stickersheet](https://github.dev.xero.com/designers/xui-design-toolkit/releases).
//
// You can use [Codepen](https://codepen.io/team/xero/) to quickly prototype XUI interfaces.
// Our team account has base templates with the correct stylesheet, icons and responsive navigation pulled in already.
// Let us know if you need a Codepen account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).

// Tips
//
// ### Start with XUI
// Work hard to make the best thing from the materials we already have.
// Introduce new concepts consciously and in parallel with the overall system.
//
// ### Speak in variables
// Remove some of the spec work by using a shared language around things like [spacing units](section-fundamentals-spacing.html), [color](section-fundamentals-colors.html) and [type size](section-fundamentals-typography.html#fundamentals-typography-20-1).
//
// ### Think responsive
// Avoid brittle interfaces by becoming familiar with the responsive tools available to you with regard to [alignment](section-building-blocks-utilities.html) and [layout](section-fundamentals-layout.html).

// Contributing
//
// There are many things XUI doesn’t yet cover – it needs your help! Talk to the design systems team if you've got questions or have ideas about how XUI should grow.
//
// Minor XUI bugs are best captured as an issue in the main [XUI Development repo](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/issues).
// Additionally, if you'd like to see things improved with the Sketch stickersheet, add an issue to the [XUI Design repo](https://github.dev.xero.com/designers/xui-design-toolkit/issues).
// Let us know if you need a Github account by contacting us on [Slack](https://xero.slack.com/messages/C56RA62Q5).
