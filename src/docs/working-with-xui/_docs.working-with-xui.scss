// Working with XUI
//
// Introduction: An introduction to XUI, and how to use it in your projects.
//
// Weight: 1.0
//
// Styleguide: Getting Started


// Introduction
//
// XUI stands for Xero User Interface.
// It’s a shared design system that enables us to build higher quality products, in less time, and in a more collaborative way.
// Initially, XUI was just a CSS library. It's now evolved to offer an ever-expanding suite of React components as well, our framework of choice.
//
// ### CSS
//
// This site is the source of truth for finding the most up to date CSS classes, tools, and best practices.
// You’ll also find handy variables for use in prototyping.
// However, it’s light on implementation detail.
// For detailed documentation on how to use XUI in your project, view our getting started guide on Github. 
// 
// [README.md](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui/blob/master/README.md)
//
// ### React
//
// At present, not everything in CSS has a matching React component.
// However, you’ll see the React symbol beside those that do.
// You can also visit our React documentation directly, to see more extensive examples, props, and markup.

// Styleguide: Getting Started.1

// Owners
//
// XUI is built by members of the UXE (User Experience Engineering) and Design Systems teams.
// Whilst these teams are tasked with creating the roadmap and managing the repository, the intention has always been that it is a shared project, and anyone is welcome to contribute.
// 
// Styleguide: Getting Started.2

// Platforms
//
// XUI is created with the responsive web in mind.
// What this means is that whilst the goal is to share content principles and interaction patterns with native platforms like iOS and Android, they remain seperate.
// 
// Styleguide: Getting Started.3

// Accessibility
//
// Making software that is accessible to everyone is extremely important to us.
// This affects many of our decisions around contrast, color, type size, to deciding how to structure our markup.
// Our goal is to be fully ARIA compliant.
// Please challenge us if anything is falling short of this goal.
// 
// Styleguide: Getting Started.4

// Designers
//
// Without a shared design system, our products lack consistency, cohesion and familiarity.
// It becomes very easy to waste time stressing over the little details.
// XUI exists to handle the boring stuff for you, so hopefully, you can focus on the experience.
// Nonetheless, as is the case with any design, it is never done.
// We welcome any suggestions you may have that would improve XUI for everyone.
// 
// Styleguide: Getting Started.5

// Developers
//
// The intention of XUI is to help us build products faster, and enable change.
// Completely bespoke interfaces make this difficult.
// But until everything in Xero is built with XUI, there’ll be a teething process.
// What this means is that a little more work upfront may be required, to help us in the long run.
// We encourage you to work closely with the UXE team to balance what parts of your project can be built with XUI, and which may still need to be created.
// 
// Styleguide: Getting Started.6

// Product teams
//
// Below you’ll find a few helpful things that will help any product team use XUI 
// - Challenge your designer
// - Talk to the UXE team often and early 
// - Get a design architect involved 
// - Consider your upgrade strategy
