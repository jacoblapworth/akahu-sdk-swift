// Working with XUI
//
// Introduction:
// XUI is a living design system that standardises Xero’s basic web application interface parts and enables them to evolve consistently. It’s ours, as an entire organisation, to nurture and grow.
//
// Weight: 1.0

// Styleguide: Getting Started

// What to expect
//
// **XUI won’t do everything.** Teams still need to carefully design the _right_ experience by composing XUI elements most effectively for their users.
//
// Currently XUI covers mainly low-level ‘atoms’ such as color or input style. It’s currently growing to include arrangements into complex components and layouts, however it’s early in that process.
//
// There will be times when pushing beyond what XUI offers delivers a significantly better, valuable experience. When that happens we encourage involvement to extend XUI over simply cutting custom code.
//
// Styleguide: Getting Started.01

// Developers
//
// There are two parts to XUI: a library of reusable [HTML and SCSS partials](./section-building-blocks.html) plus a collection of React Components that wrap some of these with consistent behaviours.
// These can be added to legacy interfaces or used to build fresh ones from the ground up.
//
// Everything in XUI is tested across the range of browsers supported by Xero and has robust accessibility baked in.

// Designers
//
// By handling the boring bits of UI design, XUI lets designers focus on creating the right interface, flow and experience.
//
// The [XUI Design Toolkit](https://github.dev.xero.com/designers/xui-design-toolkit) includes a Sketch file plus a few other goodies to speed up mockups of XUI interfaces.

// Product teams
//
// There’s a few things that help XUI-based projects run smoothly:
//
// **Get the [XUI team](./section-feedback.html#feedback-4) involved early** to help with both design and development planning: assessing what can be recycled and built upon can start at the whiteboard stage.
//
// Consider your **upgrade strategy:** [XUI releases](./section-updates.html) with new or improved tools may be available during development.
//
// **Ask lot’s of questions:** there’s [many ways](./section-feedback.html) you can!
