The StatefulPicklist is a component that wraps the Picklist to keep track of which element is highlighted and APIs to manipulate highlighting behavior. These APIs are used by components like the `DropDown` to allow the user to navigate through the menu and select an item.  Detailed information on these APIs can be found in the [DropDown section](#dropdown).
