`XUIIntroBannerBody` is the only required subcomponent of the intro banner. It is a wrapper for the content of the intro banner, and provides the recommended default layout for this component.

We recommend providing text content in the form of `<p>` elements, so that the text displays with the intended spacing and styling.
