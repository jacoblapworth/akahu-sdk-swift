/**
 * Typography settings for the Xero design
 * =======================================
 *
 * TODO: Switch to relative units.  This file used to have a variety of
 *       measurement units, each for a specific reason:
 *
 *  - rem: unit relative to the user agent's default em.  Used for font sizes to
 *         keep text content relative to browser defaults.
 *  - em: For when we want things relative to the current text context, eg:
 *        margins and line heights (as they are based around the text)
 *  - px: Used for very thin items, like: borders, dividers, radii, and shadows.
 *        ie: scaffolding items that aren't based on text content.
 *
 * We are often given pixel units by design, but for anybody considering the
 * vast array of internet-capable devices out there, we should be more
 * forward-thinking and opt for relative units such as rem or em instead.
 *
 * See: http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html
