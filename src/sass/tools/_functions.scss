// UNIT CONVERSION
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// We are often given pixel units by design, but for anybody considering the
// vast array of internet-capable devices out there, we should be more
// forward-thinking and opt for relative units such as rem or em instead.
//
// See: http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html

// Returns an em value for what design considers a pixel
// NOTE: Think first when using this one, as trying to pixel down to the em
//       level is often a sign that you're being too controlling, not letting
//       the browser do its thing (a fight that never ends well for developers).
//       Think instead of using ems to describe fractions of a context.
@function px-to-em($px, $context) {
	@return ($px / $context) + em
}

// Returns a rem value for what design considers a pixel
@function px-to-rem($px) {
	@return ($px / 16) + rem
}
